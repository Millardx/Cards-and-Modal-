Now for a long long time of debugging with GPT . The Card.jsx and AdminPage.jsx Card preview displays its image and weather icon that uploaded by the admin.

So, when uploading new image and icon in the AdminPage Card if the image and icon dont display instantly after saving it try to reload your tab/page. 


Next later . the task is to make the linked pop up modal in "View Full Details" to be editable like :
    - Create models for the modal in backend 
    - Arrange the routing in the cardRoutes or Create new routes for the modal specifically

        - the modal will have 3 images for carousel display
        - Text below that will fill details about the Area/place indicated in the card.

Lefon 
        The Modal preview sucessfully uploading data and image to the data but:
            Issues are :
                    When trying to view Edit Card sometimes the Data is not fetched(theres no error in the console)its needed to reload 2x the tab to see the existing data from the DB.
                    The image did upload and store in the DB but when trying revisiting the Page the image dont display only display the alt text of the image.
                    When uploading the problem is it didnt repalce the existing but creating new ones to store into DB.

            Task:
                Fix the issue in uploading: Make the routes just replace the existing instead of creating new record.
                Fix the issue in displaying the uploaded image to  fetch it properly and display. 
                Fix the issue in fetching delay so it wont need to reload just to fetch existing data. 

                    After that make the Modal Preview reflect on the Card.jsx Modal on the Client page. 

                When everythings is okay. Try to improve and Clean the code properly before pushing.

        The previous Issues are resolved now 
                The modal preview is displaying the images and only updating the existing upload.
                The image and texts are fetched flawlessly now. 

            Also the Client Modal is already working the backend data are now fetching to Modal Client. 
                Also added carousell display in the Modal Preview in AdminPage.

    Error:  
        trying an empty DB like fresh start.    
                When uploading 
        When i use this the data in the card preview dont display and theres already data uploaded since the Client Card is fetching data from DB:

// Check that image is a string before using startsWith
const imageUrl = (typeof image === 'string' && image && !image.startsWith('http')) ? http://localhost:5000${image} : image;
const weatherIconUrl = (typeof weatherIcon === 'string' && weatherIcon && !weatherIcon.startsWith('http')) ? http://localhost:5000${weatherIcon} : weatherIcon;


And when I use this I only received the Error "// Ensure image and weatherIcon are valid strings before using startsWith()" only appear once but when i reload it  both Admin Card preview and Client Card Have data fetched:

// Ensure image and weatherIcon are valid strings before using startsWith()
const imageUrl = (image && !image.startsWith('http')) ? http://localhost:5000${image} : image;
const weatherIconUrl = (weatherIcon && !weatherIcon.startsWith('http')) ? http://localhost:5000${weatherIcon} : weatherIcon;

Possible fix use the Use effect same as Modal as fetching data instead of this const in fetchign data.


Also the Modal when uploading a fresh data its getting error. 
POST
http://localhost:5000/modal
[HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error 38ms]


Error saving modal data: Server error while saving modal data AdminPage.jsx:160

            not important issue but 
                            Card Preview only changes data displayed when you saved it in the Card Editing.
                            Modal Preview changes data displayed instantly if you try to change text in title or description in the Modal Editing
